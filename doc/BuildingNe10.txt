=========================BUILDING METHOD=================================

NE10 uses CMake to describe the build in a platform independent manner.

First download and install cmake from cmake.org.
In Ubuntu, you can install cmake by "sudo apt-get install cmake"

---------------------------NATIVE-COMPILING------------------------------
=Unix platforms=
For Unix platforms, say the following on a terminal: (Replace $NE10PATH with the directory where this file is located.)
    cd $NE10PATH
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DGNULINUX_PLATFORM=ON ..
    make
Then the libNE10.a is placed in ./modules/ and a sample program "NE10_test_static" is placed in ./samples/. you can run it.
You might want to add -DNE10_BUILD_SHARED=ON to the cmake call to generate the dynamic library and test program "NE10_test_dynamic".

=Android platforms=
it's not common do native compiling on android, Ne10 also doesn't support it.

---------------------------CROSS-COMPILING------------------------------
=Unix platforms=:
For cross-compiling for unix platforms, the process is in the following:
    cd $NE10PATH

Open the GNUlinux_config.cmake and change the compiler toolchain to yourself.My toolchain is Linaro GCC 4.6.
In Ubuntu 11.10 you can install it by "sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi".
    set( CMAKE_C_COMPILER arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc )
    set( CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER arm-linux-gnueabi-g++ )
    set( CMAKE_ASM_COMPILER arm-linux-gnueabi-as )

    find_program(CMAKE_AR NAMES "arm-linux-gnueabi-ar")
    mark_as_advanced(CMAKE_AR)

    find_program(CMAKE_RANLIB NAMES "arm-linux-gnueabi-ranlib")
    mark_as_advanced(CMAKE_RANLIB)

Now you can use the following commands to generate makefile.
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../GNUlinux_config.cmake ..
    make

Then the libNE10.a is placed in ./modules/ and a sample program "NE10_test_static" is placed in ./samples/. you can copy these to the target and run it.
You might want to add -DNE10_BUILD_SHARED=ON to the cmake call to generate the dynamic library and test program "NE10_test_dynamic".

Note:
When you run NE10_test_dynamic on the target, you might meet the error:
    "NE10_test_dynamic: error while loading shared libraries: libNE10_shared.so.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
You can run the following command:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$NE10PATH/build/modules

=Android platforms=:
For cross-compiling for android, the note to Unix platforms also applies and before cross-compiling, you must have the android NDK installed. And then:
   cd $NE10PATH
   export ANDROID_NDK=/absolute/path/of/android-ndk
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/of/android_config.cmake ..
   make

There are also two other environment variable:
   ANDROID_API_LEVEL: used to specify android api level, default value is: 14
   ARM_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION: used be specify gcc version, default is: 4.6, gcc version must be >=4.6

=iOS platforms=
For cross-compiling for iOS, the note to Unix platforms also applies and before cross-compiling, you must have the Xcode installed. Our assembly code is written for GNU as(gas) initially, the assembler for iOS platform doesn't support it very well. However we get our code worked under Apple LLVM version 4.2 (clang-425.0.28) (based on LLVM 3.2svn) now, other toolchain(such as llvm-gcc) may not work. After Xcode installed, you should set the IOS_DEVELOPER_PATH environment variable to your Xcode path, if you haven't changed the default install path, it should be "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer". As follow:
   cd $NE10PATH
   export IOS_DEVELOPER_PATH=/absolute/path/of/ios/developer/path
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/of/ios_config.cmake ..
   make

Note:
- for cmake step: if cmake warns: ignoring CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT value and that directory does not exist, you should check your SDKs directory. And if necessary, you can specify this path in ios_config.cmake. That is changing the variable CMAKE_IOS_SDK_PATH to your configuration.
- we provide a option called: MIN_IOS_VER, which is used to specify minimal target iOS version. For example, you can add -DMIN_IOS_VER=5.0 when run cmake. MIN_IOS_VER's default value is 5.0
  And when your target is older than iOS 7.0, you should not define MIN_IOS_VER to iOS 7.0. Otherwise, it would lead runtime error.

=Ne10 demo=
There are 2 demos include Ne10, one for Android and one for iOS. Both demos need Ne10 library and it's native side interface library installed, to do that, after build NE10, you should run "make install" in the same directory. And after that, you can import or open the project file in android SDK or Xcode as usually. And please also note that your devices should be have access to internet to run the demo.

---------------------------UNIT TEST------------------------------

The unit test framework of Ne10 is based on seatest(http://code.google.com/p/seatest/).
But I also made some modifications to be more suitable for Ne10.

The unit test consists of smoke test, regression test and performance test.
If you want to do the test, you just need to add the following options when you compile the library.

smoke test       ---------->> -DNE10_BUILD_UNIT_TEST=on -DNE10_SMOKE_TEST=on
regression test  ---------->> -DNE10_BUILD_UNIT_TEST=on -DNE10_REGRESSION_TEST=on
performance test ---------->> -DNE10_BUILD_UNIT_TEST=on -DNE10_PERFORMANCE_TEST=on

example:
run the following commands.
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DNE10_BUILD_UNIT_TEST=on -DNE10_SMOKE_TEST=on ..
    make

Then the corresponding test program will be generated in the directory ./test/
