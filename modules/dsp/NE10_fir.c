/**
 * @defgroup FIR Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filters
 *
 * \par
 * This set of functions implements Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters
 * for floating-point data types.
 * The functions operate on blocks of input and output data and each call to the function processes
 * <code>blockSize</code> samples through the filter.  <code>pSrc</code> and
 * <code>pDst</code> points to input and output arrays containing <code>blockSize</code> values.
 *
 * \par Algorithm:
 * The FIR filter algorithm is based upon a sequence of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations.
 * Each filter coefficient <code>b[n]</code> is multiplied by a state variable which equals a previous input sample <code>x[n]</code>.
 * <pre>
 *    y[n] = b[0] * x[n] + b[1] * x[n-1] + b[2] * x[n-2] + ...+ b[numTaps-1] * x[n-numTaps+1]
 * </pre>
 * \par
 * \image html FIR.gif "Finite Impulse Response filter"
 * \par
 * <code>pCoeffs</code> points to a coefficient array of size <code>numTaps</code>.
 * Coefficients are stored in time reversed order.
 * \par
 * <pre>
 *    {b[numTaps-1], b[numTaps-2], b[N-2], ..., b[1], b[0]}
 * </pre>
 * \par
 * <code>pState</code> points to a state array of size <code>numTaps + blockSize - 1</code>.
 * Samples in the state buffer are stored in the following order.
 * \par
 * <pre>
 *    {x[n-numTaps+1], x[n-numTaps], x[n-numTaps-1], x[n-numTaps-2]....x[0], x[1], ..., x[blockSize-1]}
 * </pre>
 * \par
 * Note that the length of the state buffer exceeds the length of the coefficient array by <code>blockSize-1</code>.
 * The increased state buffer length allows circular addressing, which is traditionally used in the FIR filters,
 * to be avoided and yields a significant speed improvement.
 * The state variables are updated after each block of data is processed; the coefficients are untouched.
 * \par Instance Structure
 * The coefficients and state variables for a filter are stored together in an instance data structure.
 * A separate instance structure must be defined for each filter.
 * Coefficient arrays may be shared among several instances while state variable arrays cannot be shared.
 * There are separate instance structure declarations for each of the 4 supported data types.
 *
 * \par Initialization Functions
 * There is also an associated initialization function for each data type.
 * The initialization function performs the following operations:
 * - Sets the values of the internal structure fields.
 * - Zeros out the values in the state buffer.
 *
 * \par
 * Use of the initialization function is optional.
 * However, if the initialization function is used, then the instance structure cannot be placed into a const data section.
 * To place an instance structure into a const data section, the instance structure must be manually initialized.
 * Set the values in the state buffer to zeros before static initialization.
 * The code below statically initializes each of the 4 different data type filter instance structures
 * <pre>
 *ne10_fir_instance_f32_t S = {numTaps, pState, pCoeffs};
 * </pre>
 *
 * where <code>numTaps</code> is the number of filter coefficients in the filter; <code>pState</code> is the address of the state buffer;
 * <code>pCoeffs</code> is the address of the coefficient buffer.
 *
 * \par Fixed-Point Behavior
 * Care must be taken when using the fixed-point versions of the FIR filter functions.
 * In particular, the overflow and saturation behavior of the accumulator used in each function must be considered.
 * Refer to the function specific documentation below for usage guidelines.

 *
 * \par
 * These functions combine an FIR filter together with a decimator.
 * They are used in multirate systems for reducing the sample rate of a signal without introducing aliasing distortion.
 * Conceptually, the functions are equivalent to the block diagram below:
 * \image html FIRDecimator.gif "Components included in the FIR Decimator functions"
 * When decimating by a factor of <code>M</code>, the signal should be prefiltered by a lowpass filter with a normalized
 * cutoff frequency of <code>1/M</code> in order to prevent aliasing distortion.
 * The user of the function is responsible for providing the filter coefficients.
 *
 * The FIR decimator functions provided in the CMSIS DSP Library combine the FIR filter and the decimator in an efficient manner.
 * Instead of calculating all of the FIR filter outputs and discarding <code>M-1</code> out of every <code>M</code>, only the
 * samples output by the decimator are computed.
 * The functions operate on blocks of input and output data.
 * <code>pSrc</code> points to an array of <code>blockSize</code> input values and
 * <code>pDst</code> points to an array of <code>blockSize/M</code> output values.
 * In order to have an integer number of output samples <code>blockSize</code>
 * must always be a multiple of the decimation factor <code>M</code>.
 *
 * The library provides functions for floating-point data types.
 *
 * \par Algorithm:
 * The FIR portion of the algorithm uses the standard form filter:
 * <pre>
 *    y[n] = b[0] * x[n] + b[1] * x[n-1] + b[2] * x[n-2] + ...+ b[numTaps-1] * x[n-numTaps+1]
 * </pre>
 * where, <code>b[n]</code> are the filter coefficients.
 * \par
 * The <code>pCoeffs</code> points to a coefficient array of size <code>numTaps</code>.
 * Coefficients are stored in time reversed order.
 * \par
 * <pre>
 *    {b[numTaps-1], b[numTaps-2], b[N-2], ..., b[1], b[0]}
 * </pre>
 * \par
 * <code>pState</code> points to a state array of size <code>numTaps + blockSize - 1</code>.
 * Samples in the state buffer are stored in the order:
 * \par
 * <pre>
 *    {x[n-numTaps+1], x[n-numTaps], x[n-numTaps-1], x[n-numTaps-2]....x[0], x[1], ..., x[blockSize-1]}
 * </pre>
 * The state variables are updated after each block of data is processed, the coefficients are untouched.
 *
 * \par Instance Structure
 * The coefficients and state variables for a filter are stored together in an instance data structure.
 * A separate instance structure must be defined for each filter.
 * Coefficient arrays may be shared among several instances while state variable array should be allocated separately.
 * There are separate instance structure declarations for each of the 3 supported data types.
 *
 * \par Initialization Functions
 * There is also an associated initialization function for each data type.
 * The initialization function performs the following operations:
 * - Sets the values of the internal structure fields.
 * - Zeros out the values in the state buffer.
 * - Checks to make sure that the size of the input is a multiple of the decimation factor.
 *
 * \par
 * Use of the initialization function is optional.
 * However, if the initialization function is used, then the instance structure cannot be placed into a const data section.
 * To place an instance structure into a const data section, the instance structure must be manually initialized.
 * The code below statically initializes each of the 3 different data type filter instance structures
 * <pre>
 *ne10_fir_decimate_instance_f32_t S = {M, numTaps, pCoeffs, pState};
 * </pre>
 * where <code>M</code> is the decimation factor; <code>numTaps</code> is the number of filter coefficients in the filter;
 * <code>pCoeffs</code> is the address of the coefficient buffer;
 * <code>pState</code> is the address of the state buffer.
 * Be sure to set the values in the state buffer to zeros when doing static initialization.
 *
 * \par Fixed-Point Behavior
 * Care must be taken when using the fixed-point versions of the FIR decimate filter functions.
 * In particular, the overflow and saturation behavior of the accumulator used in each function must be considered.
 * Refer to the function specific documentation below for usage guidelines.

 *
 * \par
 * These functions combine an upsampler (zero stuffer) and an FIR filter.
 * They are used in multirate systems for increasing the sample rate of a signal without introducing high frequency images.
 * Conceptually, the functions are equivalent to the block diagram below:
 * \image html FIRInterpolator.gif "Components included in the FIR Interpolator functions"
 * After upsampling by a factor of <code>L</code>, the signal should be filtered by a lowpass filter with a normalized
 * cutoff frequency of <code>1/L</code> in order to eliminate high frequency copies of the spectrum.
 * The user of the function is responsible for providing the filter coefficients.
 *
 * The FIR interpolator functions provided in the CMSIS DSP Library combine the upsampler and FIR filter in an efficient manner.
 * The upsampler inserts <code>L-1</code> zeros between each sample.
 * Instead of multiplying by these zero values, the FIR filter is designed to skip them.
 * This leads to an efficient implementation without any wasted effort.
 * The functions operate on blocks of input and output data.
 * <code>pSrc</code> points to an array of <code>blockSize</code> input values and
 * <code>pDst</code> points to an array of <code>blockSize*L</code> output values.
 *
 * The library provides functions for floating-point data types.
 *
 * \par Algorithm:
 * The functions use a polyphase filter structure:
 * <pre>
 *    y[n] = b[0] * x[n] + b[L]   * x[n-1] + ... + b[L*(phaseLength-1)] * x[n-phaseLength+1]
 *    y[n+1] = b[1] * x[n] + b[L+1] * x[n-1] + ... + b[L*(phaseLength-1)+1] * x[n-phaseLength+1]
 *    ...
 *    y[n+(L-1)] = b[L-1] * x[n] + b[2*L-1] * x[n-1] + ....+ b[L*(phaseLength-1)+(L-1)] * x[n-phaseLength+1]
 * </pre>
 * This approach is more efficient than straightforward upsample-then-filter algorithms.
 * With this method the computation is reduced by a factor of <code>1/L</code> when compared to using a standard FIR filter.
 * \par
 * <code>pCoeffs</code> points to a coefficient array of size <code>numTaps</code>.
 * <code>numTaps</code> must be a multiple of the interpolation factor <code>L</code> and this is checked by the
 * initialization functions.
 * Internally, the function divides the FIR filter's impulse response into shorter filters of length
 * <code>phaseLength=numTaps/L</code>.
 * Coefficients are stored in time reversed order.
 * \par
 * <pre>
 *    {b[numTaps-1], b[numTaps-2], b[N-2], ..., b[1], b[0]}
 * </pre>
 * \par
 * <code>pState</code> points to a state array of size <code>blockSize + phaseLength - 1</code>.
 * Samples in the state buffer are stored in the order:
 * \par
 * <pre>
 *    {x[n-phaseLength+1], x[n-phaseLength], x[n-phaseLength-1], x[n-phaseLength-2]....x[0], x[1], ..., x[blockSize-1]}
 * </pre>
 * The state variables are updated after each block of data is processed, the coefficients are untouched.
 *
 * \par Instance Structure
 * The coefficients and state variables for a filter are stored together in an instance data structure.
 * A separate instance structure must be defined for each filter.
 * Coefficient arrays may be shared among several instances while state variable array should be allocated separately.
 * There are separate instance structure declarations for each of the 3 supported data types.
 *
 * \par Initialization Functions
 * There is also an associated initialization function for each data type.
 * The initialization function performs the following operations:
 * - Sets the values of the internal structure fields.
 * - Zeros out the values in the state buffer.
 * - Checks to make sure that the length of the filter is a multiple of the interpolation factor.
 *
 * \par
 * Use of the initialization function is optional.
 * However, if the initialization function is used, then the instance structure cannot be placed into a const data section.
 * To place an instance structure into a const data section, the instance structure must be manually initialized.
 * The code below statically initializes each of the 3 different data type filter instance structures
 * <pre>
 * ne10_fir_interpolate_instance_f32_t S = {L, phaseLength, pCoeffs, pState};
 * </pre>
 * where <code>L</code> is the interpolation factor; <code>phaseLength=numTaps/L</code> is the
 * length of each of the shorter FIR filters used internally,
 * <code>pCoeffs</code> is the address of the coefficient buffer;
 * <code>pState</code> is the address of the state buffer.
 * Be sure to set the values in the state buffer to zeros when doing static initialization.
 *
 * \par Fixed-Point Behavior
 * Care must be taken when using the fixed-point versions of the FIR interpolate filter functions.
 * In particular, the overflow and saturation behavior of the accumulator used in each function must be considered.
 * Refer to the function specific documentation below for usage guidelines.

 * @defgroup FIR_Sparse Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Sparse Filters
 *
 * \par
 * This group of functions implements sparse FIR filters.
 * Sparse FIR filters are equivalent to standard FIR filters except that most of the coefficients are equal to zero.
 * Sparse filters are used for simulating reflections in communications and audio applications.
 *
 * There are separate functions for floating-point data types.
 * The functions operate on blocks  of input and output data and each call to the function processes
 * <code>blockSize</code> samples through the filter.  <code>pSrc</code> and
 * <code>pDst</code> points to input and output arrays respectively containing <code>blockSize</code> values.
 *
 * \par Algorithm:
 * The sparse filter instant structure contains an array of tap indices <code>pTapDelay</code> which specifies the locations of the non-zero coefficients.
 * This is in addition to the coefficient array <code>b</code>.
 * The implementation essentially skips the multiplications by zero and leads to an efficient realization.
 * <pre>
 *     y[n] = b[0] * x[n-pTapDelay[0]] + b[1] * x[n-pTapDelay[1]] + b[2] * x[n-pTapDelay[2]] + ...+ b[numTaps-1] * x[n-pTapDelay[numTaps-1]]
 * </pre>
 * \par
 * \image html FIRSparse.gif "Sparse FIR filter.  b[n] represents the filter coefficients"
 * \par
 * <code>pCoeffs</code> points to a coefficient array of size <code>numTaps</code>;
 * <code>pTapDelay</code> points to an array of nonzero indices and is also of size <code>numTaps</code>;
 * <code>pState</code> points to a state array of size <code>maxDelay + blockSize</code>, where
 * <code>maxDelay</code> is the largest offset value that is ever used in the <code>pTapDelay</code> array.
 * Some of the processing functions also require temporary working buffers.
 *
 * \par Instance Structure
 * The coefficients and state variables for a filter are stored together in an instance data structure.
 * A separate instance structure must be defined for each filter.
 * Coefficient and offset arrays may be shared among several instances while state variable arrays cannot be shared.
 * There are separate instance structure declarations for each of the 4 supported data types.
 *
 * \par Initialization Functions
 * There is also an associated initialization function for each data type.
 * The initialization function performs the following operations:
 * - Sets the values of the internal structure fields.
 * - Zeros out the values in the state buffer.
 *
 * \par
 * Use of the initialization function is optional.
 * However, if the initialization function is used, then the instance structure cannot be placed into a const data section.
 * To place an instance structure into a const data section, the instance structure must be manually initialized.
 * Set the values in the state buffer to zeros before static initialization.
 * The code below statically initializes each of the 4 different data type filter instance structures
 * <pre>
