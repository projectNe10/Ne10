   *\par Introduction
   *
   * Ne10 (http://projectne10.github.com/Ne10/) is a library of the most commonly used functions that have been heavily
   * optimized for ARM-based CPUs with NEON. These functions provide a consistent
   * well tested behavior that can be easily incorporated into applications enabling
   * developers to get the most out of the ARM V7/NEON without arduous assembly coding.
   * Ne10 is usable as a 'drop and go' pre-built library or as a set of modular functions
   * that can be incorporated in a more modular "pick and mix" form where binary size might
   * be an issue.
   *
   * The following figure illustrates the basic concepts of "What's Ne10"

   *\par Modules Description
   * Ne10 has a modular structure, which means that the package includes several shared or static libraries.
   * Currently, the following modules are available or in plan:
   *
   * - @link groupMaths Math Functions@endlink
   * - @link groupDSPs Signal Processing Functions@endlink
   * - Physics functions
   * - Image Processing functions
   * - Others
   *
   *\par Usage
   *
   * Ne10 library provides directly and indirectly function call. you could check the @link groupSamples sample code@endlink for details
   *
   *\par Build
   *
   * See CMakeBuilding.txt file in the "doc" folder
   *
   *\par Code formatter
