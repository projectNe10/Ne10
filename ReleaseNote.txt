1. Preface
==========

1-a. License details
--------------------
NE10 is an open source project released under the Apache License,
Version 2.0 (ALv2).  See the file LICENSE for the full text of the ALv2.


1-b. Product status
-------------------
This is the first publicly available version of NE10. This open source project
is actively under development and more functions as well as improved versions of
the available functions will be contributed to the source code.


==================
2. Release details
==================

2-a. Product release status
---------------------------
Version 0.9 beta

2-b. Functions included
---------------------------
NE10 is a software library that provides Linux and Android support for Single
Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) functionality. In this release, a number of
mathematical functions (mainly vector and scalar operations) have been
implemented for the ARM v7 instruction set architecture as well as ARM NEON
SIMD architecture extensions.

This library has been developed and tested on the following processors:

  1) ARM Cortex-A9 with NEON extension
  2) ARM Cortex-A8 with NEON extension

The following is a list of currently available functions.

  a) Vector-Constant Arithmetic

   addc_float, addc_vec2f, addc_vec3f, addc_vec4f,
   subc_float, subc_vec2f, subc_vec3f, subc_vec4f,
   rsbc_float, rsbc_vec2f, rsbc_vec3f, rsbc_vec4f,
   mulc_float, mulc_vec2f, mulc_vec3f, mulc_vec4f,
   divc_float, divc_vec2f, divc_vec3f, divc_vec4f,
   setc_float, setc_vec2f, setc_vec3f, setc_vec4f,
   mlac_float, mlac_vec2f, mlac_vec3f, mlac_vec4f

  b) Arithmetic functions over arrays of cst values:

   add_float, sub_float, mul_float, div_float, mla_float, abs_float

  c) Operations on Vectors:

   len_vec2f, len_vec3f, len_vec4f
   normalize_vec2f, normalize_vec3f, normalize_vec4f


2-c. Test cases and results
---------------------------
The provided functions are categorized according to the operations that they
perform.  Functions in each of these categories accept different types of input
data. Each set is accompanied with a unit test. These unit tests are provided
as part of this library and can be used to verify and benchmark these functions
on a target platform.



===============
3. Installation
===============

3-a. Requirements
-----------------
This release has been built and tested on the following host environments:

 1) ARM Versatile Express / Linux linaro 2.6.38-1003
 2) BeagleBoard RevC / Linux linaro-developer 3.1.0-4
 3) Android AOSP Emulator / Android Open Source Project Toolchain


The source code has been successfully built with the following toolchains:

 1) Linaro GCC v4.6.1 ( https://launchpad.net/gcc-linaro/4.6 )
 2) Prebuilt GCC toolchain provided with ICS release of ASOP

To build natively on ARM

    ./nightly.pl

Will build and run a set of tests

To build as part of the Android Open Source Project, copy the release
directory into 'external' within the source directories and build as
normal.  This will install the libne10.so library into system/lib on the
final Android OS image, where other applications will be able to access it in
a similar way to other shared libraries.


3-b. Alternative Approach
-------------------------
While not supported, the functions within this library can be taken and
incorporated (licensing conflicts permitting) within other projects as is.
Details of how to do this are too project specific to detail here.
